# Binary Exploitation

> Cyber7ron | Wed 28 Oct 2020

Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a computer to execute. 

Common topics addressed by Binary Exploitation or 'pwn' challenges include:

* Registers
* The Stack
* Calling Conventions
* Global Offset Table (GOT)
* Buffers
    - Buffer Overflow
* Return Oriented Programming (ROP)
* Binary Security
    - No eXecute (NX)
    - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
    - Stack Canaries
    - Relocation Read-Only (RELRO)
* The Heap
    - Heap Exploitation
* Format String Vulnerability


## Registers

A register is a location within the processor that is able to store data

<p>Registers can hold any value: addresses (pointers), results from mathematical operations, characters, etc. Some registers are reserved however, meaning they have a special purpose and are not "general purpose registers" (GPRs). On x86, the only 2 reserved registers are</p>

```
rip a which hold the address of the next instruction to execute
rsp which the address of the stack respectively.
```

<p>On x86, the same register can have different sized accesses for backwards compatability. For example, the rax register is the full 64-bit register, eax is the low 32 bits of rax, ax is the low 16 bits, al is the low 8 bits, and ah is the high 8 bits of ax (bits 8-16 of rax).</p>

## The Stack

- last in first out.
- stack is simply an area in RAM that was chosen to be the stack - there is no special hardware to store stack contents.
