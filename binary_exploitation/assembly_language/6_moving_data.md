- movl = moves 32 bit value
		movl %eax, %ebx

- movw = moves 16 bit value
		movw %ax, %bx

- movb = moves a 8 bit value
		movb %ah, %bh

##### various ways data trasfer might happen.

1. between registers :
		movl %eax, %ebx

2. between registers and memory :
		num_label:
			.int 10

		movl %eax, num_label
		movl num_label, %ebx

3. immediate value into register
		# it moves value 10 in ebx
		movl $10, %ebx
4. immediate value into memory location :
		locaton:
			.byte 0
		movb $10, location
