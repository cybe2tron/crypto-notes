# Working With Strings in Assembly

**moving strings from one memory to another.**

		MOVSx:
		MOVSB - move a byte(8 bits)
		MOVSW - move a word(16 bits)
		MOVSL - move a double word(32)

source - `ESI` points to memory location<br>
Destination - `EDI` points to memory locations.

		.data
			#here we take two strings
			string1:
				.ascii "hello_world"
			string2:
				.ascii "just hello"

		.bss
			.lcomm Destination1, 100
			.lcomm Destination2, 100

		.text
			.globl _start

			_start:
				#simple copying using movsb,movsw,movsl

				movl $string1, %esi
				movl $destination1, %edi

				movsb
				movsw
				movsl

1. in above example first we take two initialized string.
2. then we take two uninitialized variable(in.bss segment)
3. then we copy address to `string1 ==> esi` and `destination ==> edi`
4. movsb : copy only one byte which will be `h`<br>

movsw : copy two byte which will be `el`<br>
movsl : copy four byte which will be `lo_wo`

##### The DF flag

Direction flag(DF) part of EFALGS register

Decides whether to increment / decrement ESI,EDI registers after a MOVSx instruction

if DF is set "1" => ESI,EDI registers are decrement</br>
if DF is set "0" => ESI, EDI are  incremented.

we can set DF using STD intruction<br>
we can clear DF using CLD instruction.

##### REP instruction

what happen if we want to move large string.becasue of movsb,movsw,movsl only move 8,16 and 32 bit, its studpid to call this function many times. here rep instruction comes to help.

- it used to repeat a string instruction over and over agina till the `ECX` register has a value >0

- how its work
	1. we load the ECX register with the string length
	2. use rep MOVSx instruction to copy the string from source to destination.
	3.  when each time movsx is executing ECX decrement its value and when its 0 its stop the transfer.

*Example*

		#first move addr of source and destination to esi and edi
		movl $string1, $esi
		movl $destination, $edi

		# set the string length in ecx
		movl $11, %ecx
		cld #clear the DF
		rep movsb 
		std


**Loading string from memory to registers** 
<p>for load string from memory to register we use `LODSx`</p>

Loading Strings :

1. loads into the `EAX` register
2. String source pointed to by `ESI`

this both condition should always true while using LODSx.

		LODSx:
			LODSB => load a byte from memory location into AL
			LODSW => load a word from memory into AX
			LODSL => Load a double word from memory into EAX

- ESI is automatically incremented / decremented based on DF-flag after the LODSx instruction exectues.
